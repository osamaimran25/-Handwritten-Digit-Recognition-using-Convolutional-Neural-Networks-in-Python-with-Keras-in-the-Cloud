# -Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-in-Python-with-Keras-in-the-Cloud
A project to demonstrate the capability of deep learning techniques for object recognition in image data.

In this project I have  develop a deep learning model to achieve near state of the 
art performance on the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task in Python using the Keras deep learning library.

In this  this project, you will see:

•	How to load the MNIST dataset in Keras.


•	How to develop and evaluate a baseline neural network model for the MNIST problem.

•	How to implement and evaluate a simple Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST.

•	How to implement a close to state-of-the-art deep learning model for MNIST.

##About Dataset
The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by YannLeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.

The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document dataset available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is where the name for the dataset comes from, as the Modified NIST or MNIST dataset.

Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered. This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on the machine learning with very little data cleaning or preparation required.

Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard spit of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.

It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy.

## what will we get
Excellent results achieve a prediction error of less than 1%. State-of-the-art prediction error of approximately 0.2% can be achieved with large Convolutional Neural Networks. There is a listing of the state-of-the-art results and links to the relevant papers on the MNIST and other datasets on Rodrigo Benenson’s webpage:
